Yes! All Freecode programs are completely free thanks to student volunteers and community support.
<br><br>
<b>6. How often are the classes or meetings held?</b><br>

Yes! Our goal is to reach any child eager to learn, so we plan to partner with libraries and schools in other areas as resources and volunteers allow.
